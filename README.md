Collection of basic coding, such as common library usage and algorithm.

Programming for more than 10 years, most in resource limited embedded system, I got more confused about basic coding in common PC domain. Which library should I use? Should I use a simple and quick comstomized queue implemation instead of standard library for effience? Could I use a little more memroy such as a temperory data or just in-place for simplify the code? What is the interviewer's concern? More simply and beauty? Or more effiecent?

Yes, there are too much choice in real world coding, also is limitations.

I just try to re-learn or re-practice some basic coding to improve myself. And the code is recorded here for later reference.

Scope planed:
    Java, c/c++, Python, algorithm, leetcode
